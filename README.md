# ðŸš€ Static Website Hosting on AWS (S3 + CloudFront + CloudWatch)

This project demonstrates how to host a static website on **Amazon S3**, accelerate it globally using **Amazon CloudFront**, enable **logging**, and monitor errors using **Amazon CloudWatch Alarms** with **SNS notifications**.  
All implemented on the **AWS Free Tier**.

---

### 3. Configured Bucket Policy for Public Read
- Updated bucket policy to allow public access for objects.  
- This makes the website accessible via browser.

---

### 4. Created CloudFront Distribution
- Added S3 bucket as origin.
- CloudFront provides a **global CDN endpoint** for faster delivery.

---

### 5. Enabled CloudFront Logging
- Configured CloudFront to send access logs to another S3 bucket.

---

### 6. Created CloudWatch Alarm for 5xx Errors
- Set an alarm on the metric `5xxErrorRate > 1`.  
- Sends notification if error rate crosses threshold.

---

### 7. Created SNS Topic & Subscribed for Notifications
- Created an SNS topic.  
- Subscribed email to receive alarm notifications.

## ðŸ§¹ Cleanup
To avoid costs:
1. Delete CloudFront distribution.
2. Delete CloudWatch alarms & SNS topics.
3. Delete S3 buckets (both website + logs).

---

## ðŸ“š Key Learnings
- Hosting static websites on **S3**.  
- Using **CloudFront CDN** for global distribution.  
- Enabling **logging** for monitoring.  
- Creating **CloudWatch alarms** for error detection.  
- Sending notifications via **SNS**.

âœ… This project is safe to try in the **AWS Free Tier** if cleaned up after testing.
